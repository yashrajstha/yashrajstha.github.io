I study algorithms (esp. algorithms for NP-hard problems) and organisations (esp. new forms of organisations such as online communities). I am especially interested in exploring and understanding how computer science and organization science can learn from each other in terms of concepts, methods and theories.Â 

I was born and raised in the eastern hills of Nepal. I have been a visiting scholar at Laboratory of Innovation Science, Harvard University (USA) and The Institute of Mathematical Sciences (IMSc, India). Prior to starting my PhD, from 2010-2014, I held a position as research associate at the Cluster of Excellence ([MMCI](https://www.mmci.uni-saarland.de/), Germany), which comprises of [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/home.html), the Max Planck Institute of Informatics([MPII](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/home), Germany), the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence ([DFKI](https://www.dfki.de/web), Germany), and the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems (MPI-SWScall_made). There, my research was focussed on Computational Social Choice and Theoretical Computer Science. In 2009-2010, I worked as a software engineer at Samsungcall_made.  
My research and education has been supported through scholarships and grants from several institutions including the Government of India ([EdCIL](http://www.edcilindia.co.in/)]), the German Research Foundation ([DFG](https://www.dfg.de/en/)) and the Swiss National Science Foundation ([SNSF](https://www.snf.ch/en)).
